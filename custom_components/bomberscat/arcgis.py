"""Async client for the Bombers de Catalunya ArcGIS FeatureServer.

Wraps `aiohttp` (already a Home Assistant core dependency, per
docs/04-architecture.md §2 — `requirements: []`). Responsibilities:

1. Paginated query — walk the whole dataset via `resultOffset` until
   `exceededTransferLimit` is false.
2. Incremental sync — when `since` is given, filter to rows updated after
   that timestamp and fetch them in chronological order. `coordinator.py`
   no longer calls this with a real cursor: the view enforces a rolling
   ~4-day retention window keyed on `DATA_ACT` (verified live, 2026-07-02),
   so a row that ages out simply vanishes rather than being marked closed —
   an incremental cursor can never observe that as a deletion. The
   coordinator instead does a full fetch (`since=None`) every cycle and
   reconciles by pruning act_nums absent from the result (see
   `coordinator.py`'s module docstring and `_prune_vanished`). `since` is
   kept working here (and tested) since it is harmless and may still be
   useful for a larger dataset in the future.
3. De-dup — the view is an append-only snapshot log: one
   `ACT_NUM_ACTUACIO` can have 2+ rows (see docs/01-data-sources.md §2). We
   collapse to one row per incident, keeping the one with the highest
   `DATA_ACT` (falling back to `EditDate` to break ties).
4. Retries — timeout/5xx get 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s);
   4xx errors are not retried (they usually mean the schema/URL changed).

Deviation from docs/04-architecture.md §3 (found via live query, see
tests/test_arcgis.py and the implementation report): the architecture sketch
filters/orders incremental queries by `EditDate`. Against the real
FeatureServer, `EditDate` is declared in `editFieldsInfo` but is **not** a
queryable field — it is silently dropped from `outFields=*` and using it in
`where`/`orderByFields` returns an HTTP 400 ("Invalid orderByFields"). We use
`DATA_ACT` instead, which is present on every row, already the field used
for de-dup, and works correctly for filtering/ordering.
