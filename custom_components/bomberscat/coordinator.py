"""Data update coordinator for bomberscat (Task 5) + event emission (Task 9).

Polls the Bombers ArcGIS FeatureServer (via ``arcgis.fetch_incidents``) on an
interval, applies the tracking filters/radius from docs/03-feature-spec.md
§2, and fires the ``bomberscat_fire_detected`` / ``bomberscat_phase_change`` /
``bomberscat_fire_resolved`` events from docs/03-feature-spec.md §4.

Deviation from the `BomberscatState` sketch in docs/04-architecture.md §5:
that sketch keeps *both* the current `incidents` dict *and* separate
`prev_fases` / `prev_act_nums` / `_snapshot` bookkeeping fields to compare
against on the next cycle (its `_emit_events` pseudocode even references
`state._snapshot` before it is ever assigned — a bug). We drop the separate
snapshot fields entirely: at the start of each cycle we take a shallow copy
of the *previous* `incidents` dict (`base_incidents`) and diff freshly
fetched rows against that copy while building the *new* `incidents` dict.
The new dict becomes next cycle's "previous" automatically. This is strictly
less state to keep in sync and cannot drift.

Sync strategy (deviation from docs/04-architecture.md's incremental-sync
sketch, confirmed via live-service investigation 2026-07-02): the Bombers
FeatureServer view enforces a rolling ~4-day retention window keyed on
`DATA_ACT` — a row whose latest `DATA_ACT` ages out of that window vanishes
from the view *entirely*, it is not marked closed first. `ACT_DAT_FI` is
`null` on 100% of observed rows (useless for detecting closure); closure is
instead expressed as `COM_FASE == "Extingit"`, a terminal state. Combined,
this means an incremental `since=<last DATA_ACT>` query can *never* observe
a deletion: an act_num that stops being returned just silently drops out of
the incremental window forever, and the old "carry forward whatever we last
saw" design would keep a tracked incident (and its `geo_location` entity)
alive indefinitely, never firing `bomberscat_fire_resolved`.

Given the dataset is tiny (tens of rows, comfortably one page), we instead
fetch the *entire* current view every cycle (`fetch_incidents(session,
since=None)`) and treat it as ground truth: any act_num that was tracked
last cycle but is absent from this cycle's fetch has vanished from the
source and is pruned via `_prune_vanished` (resolving it first, unless it
had already been resolved when it turned `Extingit` — see that function's
docstring). `fetch_incidents`'s `since` parameter still exists and is still
tested in arcgis.py, it is simply never passed a real cursor from here
any more. TIMESTAMP literals/epochs from the service are UTC — the existing
timezone handling in arcgis.py is correct and untouched by this change.

Error-handling semantics (docs/05-implementation-plan.md Task 5): on a fetch
failure we raise `UpdateFailed`. Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator`
only overwrites `self.data` *after* `_async_update_data` returns
successfully (see `_async_refresh` in
`homeassistant.helpers.update_coordinator`), so raising `UpdateFailed`
already guarantees the previous `BomberscatState` (and therefore all
existing entities) survives untouched — we do not need to special-case
"keep the old state" ourselves. We additionally mutate the *existing*
state's `last_error` field in place (when one exists) before raising, so
that diagnostics entities (Task 13) reading `coordinator.data.last_error`
see the new error message even though `coordinator.data` itself keeps its
old identity. `coordinator.last_update_success` (set by the base class to
`False` on `UpdateFailed`) is the canonical "is the service reachable"
signal for `binary_sensor.service_connected` (Task 13). On the very first
refresh there is no previous state to mutate, so we raise `UpdateFailed`
directly; `async_config_entry_first_refresh()` turns that into
`ConfigEntryNotReady`, which is exactly the behavior Task 5 asks for.

Event-suppression semantics (Task 9): no events are fired on the very first
successful refresh after startup/reload (`previous is None`), to avoid a
notification storm replaying every currently-active fire as "detected" on
every Home Assistant restart. In practice this only affects
`bomberscat_fire_detected`: `bomberscat_phase_change` and
`bomberscat_fire_resolved` can only fire for an incident that was *already*
tracked in a previous cycle, which is impossible on the first refresh by
construction (`base_incidents` is empty). We still suppress unconditionally
(rather than relying on that invariant) so the intent is explicit and the
code stays correct if the tracking logic ever changes.

Service-degradation semantics (Task 13, docs/04-architecture.md §9 "URL
canviada (404 persistent)"): `BomberscatState.consecutive_4xx_failures`
counts *consecutive* failures whose `ArcgisClientError.kind` is in
`_DEGRADATION_KINDS` (a 4xx response — the "schema/URL changed" signature).
It resets to 0 both on a successful refresh *and* on a failure of a
different kind (timeout/5xx/parse): a non-4xx failure in between two 404s
means the run was not actually a consecutive sequence of that specific
signature. Once the streak reaches `DEGRADED_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, we fire
`bomberscat_service_degraded` and raise a repair issue exactly once
(`BomberscatState.degraded` gates re-firing every subsequent cycle); the
repair issue is only cleared on an actual successful refresh, regardless of
what interleaving failures reset the streak counter in between — the user
should keep seeing the issue until the service demonstrably recovers, not
just until the failure *type* changes. This bookkeeping only runs once
there is a `previous` state to mutate (same first-refresh caveat as
`last_error` above): a persistent-404 on the very first refresh instead
surfaces as a normal `ConfigEntryNotReady` setup retry.
