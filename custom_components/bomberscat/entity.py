"""Shared `DeviceInfo` helper for bomberscat entities.

`sensor.py` and `binary_sensor.py` entities all belong to the integration's
single "Bombers de Catalunya" service device (`geo_location` is the
exception — it models external per-incident events, not a sub-component of
the service device, per `geo_location.py`'s module docstring, so it has no
`DeviceInfo` at all). Before this module existed, the exact same `DeviceInfo`
literal was duplicated 4x: once as `sensor.py`'s `_device_info()` helper and
three more times inline in `binary_sensor.py`. Any drift between those
copies (e.g. a typo in one of the four `name=`/`model=` strings) would have
registered *two* separate devices for the same config entry instead of one.
Both platforms now import `device_info()` from here.
